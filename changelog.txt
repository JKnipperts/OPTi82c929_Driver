Changelog

What I changed in the different released versions of the programs:

929INIT
1.1
- Bugfix: Shadowregister protection must be enabled when initializing the Sound Blaster Pro mode.
  This brings much better game compatibility.
- Bugfix: There was a bug in the code to set Mono/Stereo
- Revised the "Info" section.  Now the actual current frequency is read out and displayed.

1.2
- Added enhanced OPL4 support
- Added option for SB Pro lowpass filter configuration
- Added Stereo/Mono commandline switch
- Bugfix in AD1848.PAS: Setvolume did not function properly with volume 0
  Now values from 0 to 30 will be set correctly and audio will be muted with volume 0
- I've reworked the source code a bit 

1.21
- Minor improvement of /N command (now with a max value of 255 to avoid overrun)
- Changes and improvements in the texts and descriptions to be output.

SETUP
  1.01: 
   - Keyboard mode added: Program is now fully useable without a mouse.
   
  1.1:
   - Just fixed two stupid errors.... 
   - Bug fix: If the configuration file was not found and therefore the default 
              settings are used, due to a bug the program tried to read the  
              configuration file again and crashed. 
   - Bug fix: 
     - MPU401 will no longer be tested when MPU is disabled.....
              
  1.2
   - Added doubble check for controller detection
   - Added enhanced OPL4 support
   - Added a second page with more advanced options
   - Renamed some options. Now the names are the same as in the data sheet.
   - Two small bugfixes: 
     - Sometimes the text cursor remained switched off after the end of the program.
     - The option "protect codes shadow registers" could not be changened in keyboard mode
      
  1.3
   - Reorganization of the advanced options section
   - Added new commandline options
   - Improved WSS DMA Test and fixed an annoying bug:
      - If the sound check in the mixer was previously performed or another program previously accessed WSS, 
        the DMA test failed on the first pass. Fixed this with an additional reset of the DMA controller and 
        counter in the codec.
   - Improved the code for automatically entering the settings in Autoexec.bat and fixed some minor bugs.
